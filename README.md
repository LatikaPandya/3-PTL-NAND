# 3-PTL-NAND
In this project, I designed and simulated a compact 3-transistor NMOS NAND gate using LTspice. The objective was to understand how digital logic can be implemented using fewer transistors and to explore the trade-offs involved in low-transistor-count designs.
Designed a 2-input NAND gate using only 3 NMOS transistors
Simulated the circuit in LTspice and verified correct logical operation for all input combinations
Performed transient analysis to observe switching behavior and measure propagation delay
Studied low-to-high and high-to-low transitions
Analyzed the impact of reduced transistor count on power, delay, and output voltage levels
Gained practical experience in circuit simulation and waveform analysis
